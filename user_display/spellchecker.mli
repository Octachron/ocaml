val edit_distance : string -> string -> int -> int option
(** [edit_distance a b cutoff] computes the edit distance between
    strings [a] and [b]. To help efficiency, it uses a cutoff: if the
    distance [d] is smaller than [cutoff], it returns [Some d], else
    [None].

    The distance algorithm currently used is Damerau-Levenshtein: it
    computes the number of insertion, deletion, substitution of
    letters, or swapping of adjacent letters to go from one word to the
    other. The particular algorithm may change in the future.
*)

val spellcheck : string list -> string -> string list
(** [spellcheck env name] takes a list of names [env] that exist in
    the current environment and an erroneous [name], and returns a
    list of suggestions taken from [env], that are close enough to
    [name] that it may be a typo for one of them. *)

val did_you_mean : Format.formatter -> (unit -> string list) -> unit
(** [did_you_mean ppf get_choices] hints that the user may have meant
    one of the option returned by calling [get_choices]. It does nothing
    if the returned list is empty.

    The [unit -> ...] thunking is meant to delay any potentially-slow
    computation (typically computing edit-distance with many things
    from the current environment) to when the hint message is to be
    printed. You should print an understandable error message before
    calling [did_you_mean], so that users get a clear notification of
    the failure even if producing the hint is slow.
