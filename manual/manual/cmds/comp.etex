This chapter describes the OCaml batch compiler "ocamlc",
which compiles OCaml source files to bytecode object files and links
these object files to produce standalone bytecode executable files.
These executable files are then run by the bytecode interpreter
"ocamlrun".

\section{Overview of the compiler}

The "ocamlc" command has a command-line interface similar to the one of
most C compilers. It accepts several types of arguments and processes them
sequentially:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Arguments ending in ".mli" are taken to be source files for
compilation unit interfaces. Interfaces specify the names exported by
compilation units: they declare value names with their types, define
public data types, declare abstract data types, and so on. From the
file \var{x}".mli", the "ocamlc" compiler produces a compiled interface
in the file \var{x}".cmi".

\item
Arguments ending in ".ml" are taken to be source files for compilation
unit implementations. Implementations provide definitions for the
names exported by the unit, and also contain expressions to be
evaluated for their side-effects.  From the file \var{x}".ml", the "ocamlc"
compiler produces compiled object bytecode in the file \var{x}".cmo".

If the interface file \var{x}".mli" exists, the implementation
\var{x}".ml" is checked against the corresponding compiled interface
\var{x}".cmi", which is assumed to exist. If no interface
\var{x}".mli" is provided, the compilation of \var{x}".ml" produces a
compiled interface file \var{x}".cmi" in addition to the compiled
object code file \var{x}".cmo". The file \var{x}".cmi" produced
corresponds to an interface that exports everything that is defined in
the implementation \var{x}".ml".

\item
Arguments ending in ".cmo" are taken to be compiled object bytecode.  These
files are linked together, along with the object files obtained
by compiling ".ml" arguments (if any), and the OCaml standard
library, to produce a standalone executable program. The order in
which ".cmo" and ".ml" arguments are presented on the command line is
relevant: compilation units are initialized in that order at
run-time, and it is a link-time error to use a component of a unit
before having initialized it. Hence, a given \var{x}".cmo" file must come
before all ".cmo" files that refer to the unit \var{x}.

\item
Arguments ending in ".cma" are taken to be libraries of object bytecode.
A library of object bytecode packs in a single file a set of object
bytecode files (".cmo" files). Libraries are built with "ocamlc -a"
(see the description of the "-a" option below). The object files
contained in the library are linked as regular ".cmo" files (see
above), in the order specified when the ".cma" file was built. The
only difference is that if an object file contained in a library is
not referenced anywhere in the program, then it is not linked in.

\item
Arguments ending in ".c" are passed to the C compiler, which generates
a ".o" object file (".obj" under Windows). This object file is linked
with the program if the "-custom" flag is set (see the description of
"-custom" below).

\item
Arguments ending in ".o" or ".a" (".obj" or ".lib" under Windows)
are assumed to be C object files and libraries. They are passed to the
C linker when linking in "-custom" mode (see the description of
"-custom" below).

\item
Arguments ending in ".so" (".dll" under Windows)
are assumed to be C shared libraries (DLLs).  During linking, they are
searched for external C functions referenced from the OCaml code,
and their names are written in the generated bytecode executable.
The run-time system "ocamlrun" then loads them dynamically at program
start-up time.

\end{itemize}

The output of the linking phase is a file containing compiled bytecode
that can be executed by the OCaml bytecode interpreter:
the command named "ocamlrun". If "a.out" is the name of the file
produced by the linking phase, the command
\begin{alltt}
        ocamlrun a.out \nth{arg}{1} \nth{arg}{2} \ldots \nth{arg}{n}
\end{alltt}
executes the compiled code contained in "a.out", passing it as
arguments the character strings \nth{arg}{1} to \nth{arg}{n}.
(See chapter~\ref{c:runtime} for more details.)

On most systems, the file produced by the linking
phase can be run directly, as in:
\begin{alltt}
        ./a.out \nth{arg}{1} \nth{arg}{2} \ldots \nth{arg}{n}
\end{alltt}
The produced file has the executable bit set, and it manages to launch
the bytecode interpreter by itself.

\section{Options}\label{s:comp-options}

The following command-line options are recognized by "ocamlc".
The options "-pack", "-a", "-c" and "-output-obj" are mutually exclusive.

\noindent
On native Windows, the following environment variable is also consulted:

\begin{options}
\item["OCAML_FLEXLINK"]  Alternative executable to use instead of the
configured value. Primarily used for bootstrapping.
\end{options}

\section{Modules and the file system}

This short section is intended to clarify the relationship between the
names of the modules corresponding to compilation units and the names
of the files that contain their compiled interface and compiled
implementation.

The compiler always derives the module name by taking the capitalized
base name of the source file (".ml" or ".mli" file).  That is, it
strips the leading directory name, if any, as well as the ".ml" or
".mli" suffix; then, it set the first letter to uppercase, in order to
comply with the requirement that module names must be capitalized.
For instance, compiling the file "mylib/misc.ml" provides an
implementation for the module named "Misc". Other compilation units
may refer to components defined in "mylib/misc.ml" under the names
"Misc."\var{name}; they can also do "open Misc", then use unqualified
names \var{name}.

The ".cmi" and ".cmo" files produced by the compiler have the same
base name as the source file. Hence, the compiled files always have
their base name equal (modulo capitalization of the first letter) to
the name of the module they describe (for ".cmi" files) or implement
(for ".cmo" files).

When the compiler encounters a reference to a free module identifier
"Mod", it looks in the search path for a file named "Mod.cmi" or "mod.cmi"
and loads the compiled interface
contained in that file. As a consequence, renaming ".cmi" files is not
advised: the name of a ".cmi" file must always correspond to the name
of the compilation unit it implements. It is admissible to move them
to another directory, if their base name is preserved, and the correct
"-I" options are given to the compiler. The compiler will flag an
error if it loads a ".cmi" file that has been renamed.

Compiled bytecode files (".cmo" files), on the other hand, can be
freely renamed once created. That's because the linker never attempts
to find by itself the ".cmo" file that implements a module with a
given name: it relies instead on the user providing the list of ".cmo"
files by hand.

\section{Common errors} \label{s:comp-errors}

This section describes and explains the most frequently encountered
error messages.

\begin{options}

\item[Cannot find file \var{filename}]
The named file could not be found in the current directory, nor in the
directories of the search path. The \var{filename} is either a
compiled interface file (".cmi" file), or a compiled bytecode file
(".cmo" file). If \var{filename} has the format \var{mod}".cmi", this
means you are trying to compile a file that references identifiers
from module \var{mod}, but you have not yet compiled an interface for
module \var{mod}. Fix: compile \var{mod}".mli" or \var{mod}".ml"
first, to create the compiled interface \var{mod}".cmi".

If \var{filename} has the format \var{mod}".cmo", this
means you are trying to link a bytecode object file that does not
exist yet. Fix: compile \var{mod}".ml" first.

If your program spans several directories, this error can also appear
because you haven't specified the directories to look into. Fix: add
the correct "-I" options to the command line.

\item[Corrupted compiled interface \var{filename}]
The compiler produces this error when it tries to read a compiled
interface file (".cmi" file) that has the wrong structure. This means
something went wrong when this ".cmi" file was written: the disk was
full, the compiler was interrupted in the middle of the file creation,
and so on. This error can also appear if a ".cmi" file is modified after
its creation by the compiler. Fix: remove the corrupted ".cmi" file,
and rebuild it.

\item[This expression has type \nth{t}{1}, but is used with type \nth{t}{2}]
This is by far the most common type error in programs. Type \nth{t}{1} is
the type inferred for the expression (the part of the program that is
displayed in the error message), by looking at the expression itself.
Type \nth{t}{2} is the type expected by the context of the expression; it
is deduced by looking at how the value of this expression is used in
the rest of the program. If the two types \nth{t}{1} and \nth{t}{2} are not
compatible, then the error above is produced.

In some cases, it is hard to understand why the two types \nth{t}{1} and
\nth{t}{2} are incompatible. For instance, the compiler can report that
``expression of type "foo" cannot be used with type "foo"'', and it
really seems that the two types "foo" are compatible. This is not
always true. Two type constructors can have the same name, but
actually represent different types. This can happen if a type
constructor is redefined. Example:
\begin{verbatim}
        type foo = A | B
        let f = function A -> 0 | B -> 1
        type foo = C | D
        f C
\end{verbatim}
This result in the error message ``expression "C" of type "foo" cannot
be used with type "foo"''.

\item[The type of this expression, \var{t}, contains type variables
      that cannot be generalized]
Type variables ("'a", "'b", \ldots) in a type \var{t} can be in either
of two states: generalized (which means that the type \var{t} is valid
for all possible instantiations of the variables) and not generalized
(which means that the type \var{t} is valid only for one instantiation
of the variables). In a "let" binding "let "\var{name}" = "\var{expr},
the type-checker normally generalizes as many type variables as
possible in the type of \var{expr}. However, this leads to unsoundness
(a well-typed program can crash) in conjunction with polymorphic
mutable data structures. To avoid this, generalization is performed at
"let" bindings only if the bound expression \var{expr} belongs to the
class of ``syntactic values'', which includes constants, identifiers,
functions, tuples of syntactic values, etc. In all other cases (for
instance, \var{expr} is a function application), a polymorphic mutable
could have been created and generalization is therefore turned off for
all variables occurring in contravariant or non-variant branches of the
type. For instance, if the type of a non-value is "'a list" the
variable is generalizable ("list" is a covariant type constructor),
but not in "'a list -> 'a list" (the left branch of "->" is
contravariant) or "'a ref" ("ref" is non-variant).

Non-generalized type variables in a type cause no difficulties inside
a given structure or compilation unit (the contents of a ".ml" file,
or an interactive session), but they cannot be allowed inside
signatures nor in compiled interfaces (".cmi" file), because they
could be used inconsistently later. Therefore, the compiler
flags an error when a structure or compilation unit defines a value
\var{name} whose type contains non-generalized type variables. There
are two ways to fix this error:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add a type constraint or a ".mli" file to give a monomorphic
type (without type variables) to \var{name}. For instance, instead of
writing
\begin{verbatim}
    let sort_int_list = Sort.list (<)
    (* inferred type 'a list -> 'a list, with 'a not generalized *)
\end{verbatim}
write
\begin{verbatim}
    let sort_int_list = (Sort.list (<) : int list -> int list);;
\end{verbatim}
\item If you really need \var{name} to have a polymorphic type, turn
its defining expression into a function by adding an extra parameter.
For instance, instead of writing
\begin{verbatim}
    let map_length = List.map Array.length
    (* inferred type 'a array list -> int list, with 'a not generalized *)
\end{verbatim}
write
\begin{verbatim}
    let map_length lv = List.map Array.length lv
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\item[Reference to undefined global \var{mod}]
This error appears when trying to link an incomplete or incorrectly
ordered set of files. Either you have forgotten to provide an
implementation for the compilation unit named \var{mod} on the command line
(typically, the file named \var{mod}".cmo", or a library containing
that file). Fix: add the missing ".ml" or ".cmo" file to the command
line.  Or, you have provided an implementation for the module named
\var{mod}, but it comes too late on the command line: the
implementation of \var{mod} must come before all bytecode object files
that reference \var{mod}. Fix: change the order of ".ml" and ".cmo"
files on the command line.

Of course, you will always encounter this error if you have mutually
recursive functions across modules. That is, function "Mod1.f" calls
function "Mod2.g", and function "Mod2.g" calls function "Mod1.f".
In this case, no matter what permutations you perform on the command
line, the program will be rejected at link-time. Fixes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Put "f" and "g" in the same module.
\item Parameterize one function by the other.
That is, instead of having
\begin{verbatim}
mod1.ml:    let f x = ... Mod2.g ...
mod2.ml:    let g y = ... Mod1.f ...
\end{verbatim}
define
\begin{verbatim}
mod1.ml:    let f g x = ... g ...
mod2.ml:    let rec g y = ... Mod1.f g ...
\end{verbatim}
and link "mod1.cmo" before "mod2.cmo".
\item Use a reference to hold one of the two functions, as in :
\begin{verbatim}
mod1.ml:    let forward_g =
                ref((fun x -> failwith "forward_g") : <type>)
            let f x = ... !forward_g ...
mod2.ml:    let g y = ... Mod1.f ...
            let _ = Mod1.forward_g := g
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\item[The external function \var{f} is not available]
This error appears when trying to link code that calls external
functions written in C.  As explained in
chapter~\ref{c:intf-c}, such code must be linked with C libraries that
implement the required \var{f} C function.  If the C libraries in
question are not shared libraries (DLLs), the code must be linked in
``custom runtime'' mode.  Fix: add the required C libraries to the
command line, and possibly the "-custom" option.
