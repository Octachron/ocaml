(Introduced in OCaml 4.14)

Note: this feature is considered experimental, and its interface may
evolve, with user feedback, in the next few releases of the language.

Consider the simple way of implementing the "List.map" function:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
let rec map f li =
  match li with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs ->
    let y = f x in
    y :: map f xs
\end{caml_example*}

A well-known limitation of this implementation is that the recursive
call, "map f xs", is not in \emph{tail} position. The runtime needs to
remember to continue with "y :: _" after the call returns and, as
a result, this function consumes some amount of call-stack space on
each recursive call. The stack usage of "map f li" is proportional to
the length of "li". This is a correctness issue for large lists on
operating systems with limited stack space -- the dreaded
"Stack_overflow" exception.

\begin{caml_example}{toplevel}
List.length (map Fun.id (List.init 1_000_000 (fun i -> i)));;
\end{caml_example}

In this implementation of "map", the recursive call happens in
a position that is not a \emph{tail} position in the program, but
within a datatype constructor application that is itself in
\emph{tail} position. We say that those positions, that are composed
of tail positions and constructor applications, are \emph{tail modulo
constructor} positions.

It is possible to rewrite programs such that \emph{tail modulo cons}
positions become tail positions; after this transformation, the
implementation of "map" above becomes \emph{tail-recursive}, in the
sense that it only consumes a constant amount of stack space. The
OCaml compiler implements this transformation on demand, using the
"[\@tail_mod_cons]" or "[\@ocaml.tail_mod_cons]" attribute on the
function to transform.

\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map f li =
  match li with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs ->
    let y = f x in
    y :: map f xs
\end{caml_example*}

\begin{caml_example}{toplevel}
List.length (map Fun.id (List.init 1_000_000 (fun i -> i)));;
\end{caml_example}

This transformation only improves calls in tail-modulo-cons position,
it does not improve recursive calls that do not fit in this fragment:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}[warning=71]
(* does *not* work: addition is not a data constructor *)
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec length li =
  match li with
  | [] -> 0
  | _ :: xs -> 1 + length li
\end{caml_example*}

It is of course possible to use the "[\@tail_mod_cons]" transformation
on programs that contain some recursive calls in tail-modulo-cons
position, and some calls in other, arbitrary positions. Only the tail
calls and tail-modulo-cons calls will happen in constant stack space.

\paragraph{General design} This feature is provided as an explicit
program transformation, not an implicit optimization. It is
annotation-driven: the user is expected to express their intent by
adding annotations in the program, and will be asked to do so in any
ambiguous situation.

We expect it to be used mostly by advanced OCaml users needing to get
some guarantees on the stack-consumption behavior of their
programs. Our recommendation is to use the "[\@tailcall]" annotation on
all callsites that should not consume any stack
space. "[\@tail_mod_cons]" extends the set of programs on which calls
can be annotated to be tail, helping establish stack-consumption
guarantees in more cases.

\paragraph{Performance} A standard approach to get a tail-recursive
version of "List.map" is to use an accumulator to collect output
elements, and reverse it at the end of the traversal.

\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
let rec map f li = map_aux f [] li
and map_aux f acc li =
  match li with
  | [] -> List.rev acc
  | x :: xs ->
    let y = f x in
    map_aux f (y :: acc) xs
\end{caml_example*}

This version is tail-recursive, but it is measurably slower than the
simple, non-tail-recursive version. In contrast, the tail-mod-cons
transformation provides an implementation that has comparable
performance to the original version, even on small inputs.

\paragraph{Evaluation order} Beware that the tail-modulo-cons
transformation has an effect on evaluation order: the constructor
argument that is transformed into tail-position will always be
evaluated last. Consider the following example:

\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
type 'a two_headed_list =
  | Nil
  | Consnoc of 'a * 'a two_headed_list * 'a

let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map f = function
  | Nil -> Nil
  | Consnoc (front, body, rear) ->
    Consnoc (f front, map f body, f rear)
\end{caml_example*}

Due to the "[\@tail_mod_cons]" transformation, the calls to "f front"
and "f rear" will be evaluated before "map f body". In particular,
this is likely to be different from the evaluation order of the
un-annotated version. (The evaluation order of constructor arguments
is unspecified in OCaml, but many implementations typically use
left-to-right or right-to-left.)

This effect on evaluation order is one of the reasons why the
tail-modulo-cons transformation has to be explicitly requested by the
user, instead of being applied as an automatic optimization to some
functions.

\paragraph{Why tail-modulo-cons?} Other program transformations, in
particular a transformation to continuation-passing style (CPS), can
make all functions tail-recursive, instead of targeting only a small
fragment. Some reasons to provide builtin support for the less-general
tail-mod-cons are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The tail-mod-cons transformation preserves the performance of
  the original, non-tail-recursive version, while
  a continuation-passing-style transformation incurs a measurable
  constant-factor overhead.
\item The tail-mod-cons transformation cannot be expressed as
  a source-to-source transformation of OCaml programs, as it relies on
  mutable state in type-unsafe ways. In contrast,
  continuation-passing-style versions can be written by hand, possibly
  using a convenient monadic notation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disambiguation}

It may happen that several arguments of a constructor are recursive
calls to a tail-modulo-cons function. The transformation can only turn
one of these calls into a tail call. It will not make a choice
implicitly, but ask the user to disambiguate explicitly.

Consider for example this type of syntactic expressions (assuming some
pre-existing type "var" of expression variables):
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
type var (* some pre-existing type of variables *)

type exp =
  | Var of var
  | Let of binding * exp
and binding = var * exp
\end{caml_example*}

Consider a "map" function on variables. The direct definition has two
recursive calls inside arguments of the "Let" constructor, so it gets
rejected as ambiguous.
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}[error]
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map_vars f exp =
  match exp with
  | Var v -> Var (f v)
  | Let ((v, def), body) ->
    Let ((f v, map_vars f def), map_vars f body)
\end{caml_example*}

To disambiguate, the user should add a "[\@tailcall]" attribute to the
recursive call that they want to see in tail position:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map_vars f exp =
  match exp with
  | Var v -> Var (f v)
  | Let ((v, def), body) ->
    Let ((f v, map_vars f def), (map_vars[@tailcall]) f body)
\end{caml_example*}
Beware that the resulting function is \emph{not} tail-recursive, the
recursive call on "def" will consume stack space. However, expression
trees tend to unbalanced on the right (lots of "Let" in sequence,
rather than nested inside each other), so putting the call on "body"
in tail position is an interesting improvement over the naive
definition: it gives bounded stack space consumption if we assume
a bound on the nesting depth of "Let" constructs.

One would also get an error when using conflicting annotations, asking
for two of the constructor arguments to be put in tail position:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}[error]
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map_vars f exp =
  match exp with
  | Var v -> Var (f v)
  | Let ((v, def), body) ->
    Let ((f v, (map_vars[@tailcall]) f def), (map_vars[@tailcall]) f body)
\end{caml_example*}

\subsection{Danger: getting out of tail-mod-cons}

Due to the nature of the tail-mod-cons transformation
(see Section~\ref{ss:details} for a presentation of transformation):
\begin{itemize}
\item Calls from a tail-mod-cons function to another tail-mod-cons
  function declared in the same recursive-binding group are ``tail
  calls'', whether they occur in tail position or in tail-modulo-cons
  positions.
\item Calls from a function \emph{not} marked tail-mod-cons to
  a tail-mod-cons function or, conversely, from a tail-mod-cons
  function to a not-tail-mod-cons function are \emph{not} tail calls,
  even if they syntactically appear in tail position in the source
  program.
\end{itemize}

The fact that calls in tail position in the source program may become
non-tail calls if they go from a tail-mod-cons to a non-tail-mod-cons
function is surprising, and the transformation will warn about them.

For example:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}[warning=71]
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec flatten = function
| [] -> []
| xs :: xss ->
    let rec append_flatten xs xss =
      match xs with
      | [] -> flatten xss
      | x :: xs -> x :: append_flatten xs xss
    in append_flatten xs xss
\end{caml_example*}
Here the "append_flatten" helper is not annotated with
"[\@tail_mod_cons]", so the calls "append_flatten xs xss" and "flatten
xss" will \emph{not} be tail calls. The right fix here is to mark
"append_flatten" to be tail-mod-cons.

\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec flatten = function
| [] -> []
| xs :: xss ->
    let[@tail_mod_cons] rec append_flatten xs xss =
      match xs with
      | [] -> flatten xss
      | x :: xs -> x :: append_flatten xs xss
    in append_flatten xs xss
\end{caml_example*}

The same warning occurs when "append_flatten" is a non-tail-mod-cons
function of the same recursive group; using the tail-mod-cons
transformation is a property of individual functions, not whole
recursive groups.
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}[warning]
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec flatten = function
| [] -> []
| xs :: xss ->
  append_flatten xs xss

and append_flatten xs xss =
  match xs with
  | [] -> flatten xss
  | x :: xs -> x :: append_flatten xs xss
\end{caml_example*}

Again the fix is to specialized "append_flatten" as well:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec flatten = function
| [] -> []
| xs :: xss ->
  append_flatten xs xss

and[@tail_mod_cons] append_flatten xs xss =
  match xs with
  | [] -> flatten xss
  | x :: xs -> x :: append_flatten xs xss
\end{caml_example*}

Non-recursive functions can also be marked "[\@tail_mod_cons]"; this is
typically useful for local bindings to recursive functions.

Incorrect version:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}[warning]
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map_vars f exp =
  let self exp = map_vars f exp in
  match exp with
  | Var v -> Var (f v)
  | Let ((v, def), body) ->
    Let ((f v, self def), (self[@tailcall]) body)
\end{caml_example*}

Recommend fix:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map_vars f exp =
  let[@tail_mod_cons] self exp = map_vars f exp in
  match exp with
  | Var v -> Var (f v)
  | Let ((v, def), body) ->
    Let ((f v, self def), (self[@tailcall]) body)
\end{caml_example*}

In other cases, there is no benefit in making the called function
tail-mod-cons, or it is not possible, for example it is a function
parameter (the transformation only works with calls to
known functions).

For example, consider a substitution function on binary trees:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}[warning]
type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree

let[@tail_mod_cons rec bind (f : 'a -> 'a tree) (t : 'a tree) : 'a tree =
  match t with
  | Leaf v -> f v
  | Node (left, right) -> Node (bind f left, (bind[@tailcall]) f right)
\end{caml_example*}

Here "f" is a function parameter, not a direct call, and the current
implementation is strictly first-order, it does not support
tail-mod-cons arguments. In this case, the user should indicate that
they realize this call to "f v" is not, in fact, in tail position, by
using "(f[@tailcall false]) v".

\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree

let[@tail_mod_cons] rec bind (f : 'a -> 'a tree) (t : 'a tree) : 'a tree =
  match t with
  | Leaf v -> (f[@tailcall false]) v
  | Node (left, right) -> Node (bind f left, (bind[@tailcall]) f right)
\end{caml_example*}

\subsection{Details on the transformation}
\label{ss:details}

To use this advanced feature, it helps to have an idea of what the
program transformation does.

Recall our "map" example:
\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}
let rec map f li =
  match li with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs ->
    let y = f x in
    y :: map f xs
\end{caml_example*}

Below is a description of the transformed program in pseudo-OCaml
notation: some operations are not expressible as source OCaml
program. (The transformation in fact happens on the Lambda
intermediary representation of the OCaml compiler)

\begin{verbatim}
let rec map f li =
  match li with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs ->
    let y = f x in
    let dst = y ::{mutable} Hole in
    map_dps f li dst 1;
    dst

and map_dps f li dst idx =
  match li with
  | [] -> dst.idx <- []
  | x :: xs ->
    let y = f x in
    let dst' = y ::{mutable} Hole in
    dst.idx <- dst';
    map_dps f li dst' 1
\end{verbatim}

The source version of "map" gets transformed into two functions,
a \emph{direct-style} version that is also called "map", and
a \emph{destination-passing-style} version (DPS) called "map_dps". The
destination-passing-style version does not return a result directly,
instead it writes it into a memory location specified by two
additional function parameters, "dst" (a memory block) and "i"
(a position within the memory block).

The source call "y :: map f xs" gets transformed into the creation of
a mutable block "y ::{mutable} Hole", whose second parameter is an
un-initialized \emph{hole}. The block is then passed to "map_dps" as
a destination parameter (with offset "1").

Notice that "map" does not call itself recursively, it calls
"map_dps". Then, "map_dps" calls itself recursively, in
a tail-recursive way.

The call from "map" to "map_dps" is \emph{not} a tail call (this is
something that we could improve in the future); but this call happens
only once when invoking "map f li", with all list elements after the
first one processed in constant stack by "map_dps".

This explains the ``getting ouf of tail-mod-cons''
subtleties. Consider our previous example involving mutual recursion
between "flatten" and "append_flatten".
\begin{verbatim}
let[@tail_mod_cons] rec flatten li =
  match li with
  | [] -> []
  | xs :: xss ->
    append_flatten xs xss
\end{verbatim}

The call to "append_flatten", which syntactically appears in tail
position, gets transformed differently whether the function has
a destination-passing-style version available -- depending on whether
it is itself marked "[\@tail_mod_cons]":
\begin{verbatim}
(* if append_flatten_dps exists *)
and flatten_dps li dst i =
  match li with
  | [] -> dst.i <- []
  | xs :: xss ->
    append_flatten_dps xs xss dst i

(* if append_flatten_dps does not exist *)
and rec flatten_dps li dst i =
  match li with
  | [] -> dst.i <- []
  | xs :: xss ->
    dst.i <- append_flatten xs xss
\end{verbatim}
If "append_flatten" does not have a destination-passing-style version,
the call gets transformed to a non-tail call.

\subsection{Current limitations}

\paragraph{Local, first-order transformation} When a function gets
transformed with tail-mod-cons, two definitions are generated, one
providing a direct-style interface and one providing the
destination-passing-style version. However, not all calls to this
function in tail-modulo-cons position will use the
destination-passing-style version and become tail calls:
\begin{itemize}
\item The transformation is local: only tail-mod-cons calls to "foo"
  within the same compilation unit as "foo" become tail calls.
\item The transformation is first-order: only direct calls that
  a known tail-mod-cons functions become tail calls when in
  tail-mod-cons position, never calls to function parameters.
\end{itemize}

Consier the call "Option.map foo x" for example: even if "foo" is
called in tail-mod-cons position within the definition of
"Option.map", that call will never become a tail call. (This would the
case even if the call to "Option.map" was inside the "Option"
module.)

In general this limitation is not a problem for recursive functions:
the first call from an outside module or a higher-order function will
consume stack space, but further recursive calls in tail-mod-cons
position will get optimized. For example if "List.map" is defined as
a tail-mod-cons function, calls from outside the "List" module will
not become tail calls when in tail positions, but the recursive calls
within the definition of "List.map" are in tail-modulo-cons positions
and do become tail calls: processing the first element of the list
will consume stack space, but all further elements are handled in
constant space.

The limitations may be an issue in more complex situations where
mutual recursion happens between functions, with some functions not
marked tail-mod-cons, or defined across different modules, or called
indirectly, for example thourgh function paramaters.

\paragraph{Non-exact calls to tupled functions} OCaml performs an
implicit optimization for "tupled" functions, which take a single
parameter that is a tuple: "let f (x, y, z) = ...". Direct calls to
these functions whose argument is a tuple literal "f (a, b, c)" will
call the "tupled" function passing three parameters directly, instead
of building a tuples. Other calls, either indirect calls or calls
passing a more complex tuple value ("let t = (a, b, c) in f t") are
compiled as ``inexact'' calls that go through a wrapper.

The "[\@tail_mod_cons]" transformation supports tupled functions, but
will only optimize ``exact'' calls in tail position; direct calls to
something else than a tuple literal will not become tail calls. The
user can manually unpack a tuple to force a call to be ``exact'': "let
(x, y, z) = t in f (x, y, z)". If there is any doubt of whether a call
can be tail-mod-cons-optimized or not, you can use the "[\@tailcall]"
annotation on the called function, which will warn if the
transformation is not possible.

\begin{caml_example*}{verbatim}[warning=51]
let rec map (f, li) =
  match li with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs ->
    let y = f x in
    let args = (f, xs) in
    (* this inexact call cannot be tail-optimized, so a warning will be raised *)
    y :: (map[@tailcall]) args
\end{caml_example*}
